# CNN-crack-detection-module
This is a project about a module that detects cracks using machine learning image recognition technology. For the image recognition algorithm, we used a CNN algorithm, darkflow, YOLO algorithm to locate the cracks from the camera image data. We also used a ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance between the crack and the camera.

# What you need

this module basically runs on a raspberry pi so a basic
- raspberry pi 3b+
- raspberry pi camera
- ultrasonic distance sensor
- digital button switch
- raspberry pi display (optional)
- wires etc
